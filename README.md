# CodeFactory.Formatting.CSharp
This open source project provides extended formatting for C# code output - intended for use by a CodeFactory automation template author.  The final output is published as a Nuget Package which makes available all of the formatting helpers to implementing authors.

## New to CodeFactory?
In the simplest terms, [CodeFactory](www.codefactory.software) is a real time software factory that is triggered from inside Visual Studio during the design and construction of software. CodeFactory allows for development staff to automate repetitive development tasks that consume much of a developerâ€™s time.

Please see the following link for further information and guidance about the [CodeFactory Runtime](https://github.com/CodeFactoryLLC/CodeFactory) or the [CodeFactory SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeFactorySDK/).

## Core purpose of this project

- C# Lanuguage

  - Class helpers
  - Enum helpers
  - Event helpers
